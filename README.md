# GroupChat

Just a side project I wanted to make. A chat app like discord with 99% less features. Really basic, but functional.
It uses a kahoot based joining system for joining chat groups which is a "room" code/pin. New "rooms" can also be created with ease. 
I am planning on making a decentralized version of this chat app, but for now it runs on a web server using PHP and MYSQL for backend.
